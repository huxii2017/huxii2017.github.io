# ðŸ§¬ Xi's Personal Websites ðŸ§¬

Welcome to my personal website â€” [https://huxii2017.github.io](https://huxii2017.github.io)

This site serves as a living notebook that documents my research, data science explorations, and visualization practices.  

It is built with **Jekyll + GitHub Pages**, featuring a collection of interactive galleries, color-themed notebooks, and reproducible pipelines in **Python**, **R** and **Shell**.
