    Iâ€™m genuinely excited that I finally sat down to reflect on the last few years and
    actually build my own personal website. ðŸŽ‰ 
  </br>
</br>
    The clean, elegant layout was inspired by
    <a href="https://fchollet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="color:#e2b44d;">FranÃ§ois Cholletâ€™s homepage</a>,
    which nudged me to keep things simple and focused.
  </br>
</br>
    Special thanks to <strong>ChatGPT</strong> for accelerating the development of this website and efficiently turning my design taste into reality throughout the project.
  </br>
</br>
    Iâ€™ll keep iterating and adding new content. Thanks for stopping by, and stay tuned. ðŸš€
